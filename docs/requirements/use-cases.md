# Use Cases

**Project:** Monnig Meteorite Gallery Tour App
**Team:** _[Team NN]_
**Client:** _[Client name and organization]_
**Version:** 0.1

---

_**How to use this template.** Instructions appear in italic square brackets. Fill in underneath them and leave them in place until the document is stable._

_**What a use case is.** One goal a user can accomplish with your system, written as the dialogue between the actor and the system, including what happens when it goes wrong. It is the unit of work in this course: one use case becomes one issue, one branch, one pull request, and one set of tests._

_**Why the use case and not the user story.** You will meet user stories in industry, and they are a good planning tool: "As a student, I want to submit my report so that I get credit." A story is deliberately under-specified, because it is a **placeholder for a conversation** that happens later, between people. That is exactly the wrong property when the thing building your code is an agent that will implement precisely what the specification says and never ask what you meant. Use stories to plan and prioritize. Build against use cases._

_The difference that matters is the parts a story does not have: preconditions, the step-by-step flow, and above all the **extensions**, which is where the failure paths live. Most defects your team ships this semester will be in a path nobody wrote down._

## Identifiers

_Use cases are identified as `UC-<AREA>-<slug>`, where the area code groups related functionality and the slug is coined from the goal: `UC-RUB-create-rubric`, `UC-WAR-manage-activities`, `UC-STU-invite-students`._

_Pick your own area codes from your project's feature areas, three or four letters each, and list them at the top of the Use Case List. Areas correspond to the `FEAT-*` entries in your [vision and scope](vision-and-scope.md), which is where use cases come from._

_**Never renumber, rename, or repoint an identifier.** Moving a use case between areas would change its identifier, so put it in the right area the first time, and if you get it wrong, leave it. An identifier is an address, not a description._

_Within one use case, `PRE-1`, `POST-1`, and the step numbers are local and may be renumbered freely, because nothing outside the use case cites them._

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

_[One paragraph: this document specifies the goals users can accomplish with the system, in enough detail that a developer knows what to build and a tester knows what to check.]_

### 1.2 Scope

_[Which feature areas from the vision and scope are covered here. Name the `FEAT-*` entries. If a feature has no use cases yet, say so rather than leaving the reader to notice.]_

---

## 2. Use Case Template

_[The field definitions. Every use case below uses exactly these fields, in this order.]_

**UC ID and Name.** _The identifier plus a concise name stating the value this use case provides to a user. Begin with an action verb, followed by an object: "Create a rubric", not "Rubric creation" and not "Rubric management", which is a feature, not a goal._

**Created By** and **Date Created.** _Who wrote it, and when._

**Primary and Secondary Actors.** _An actor is a person or other entity outside the system that interacts with it. The primary actor initiates this use case; secondary actors participate in completing it. Actors usually correspond to the user classes you identified in the vision and scope._

**Trigger.** _The business event, system event, or user action that starts the use case. The trigger tells the system to begin testing the preconditions._

**Description.** _A brief statement of the reason for and the outcome of this use case._

**Preconditions.** _What must already be true before this use case can start. **The system must be able to test each precondition**, which is what separates a precondition from a hope. Label them `PRE-1`, `PRE-2`. Example: PRE-1. The user's identity has been authenticated._

**Postconditions.** _The state of the system at successful conclusion. Label them `POST-1`, `POST-2`. Example: POST-1. The price of the item in the database has been updated with the new value._

**Main Success Scenario.** _The actor's actions and the system's responses under normal, expected conditions, as a numbered list that alternates between the two and ends by accomplishing the goal in the name. Write "The system validates..." not "The system will validate..."; use cases are written in the present tense._

**Extensions.** _Where the real work is. Two kinds, both numbered relative to the step they branch from:_

- _**Alternative flows**, other ways the use case can still succeed. Number them `4a`, `4b` for branches from step 4, with their own sub-steps `4a1`, `4a2`. Say where the flow branches off and, if it does, where it rejoins._
- _**Exceptions**, anticipated error conditions and how the system responds. Numbered the same way._

_**A use case with no extensions is not finished.** For every step, ask: what if the input is invalid, the thing is not found, the user cancels, the user is not allowed, or the external system is down? An agent building from a flow with no failure paths will invent the error handling, and you will not find out until a demo._

**Priority.** _Relative priority of implementing this. Use the same scheme across all your use cases._

**Frequency of Use.** _Roughly how often this is performed, per an appropriate unit of time. An early indicator of load, concurrency, and transaction volume, and it is the field that tells your architecture which use cases matter._

**Business Rules.** _The `BR-*` identifiers that govern this use case. **Identifiers only, never the rule's text**, so the rule has one home in [business-rules.md](business-rules.md) and cannot go stale here._

**Associated Information.** _Everything a developer needs that is not a step: the data fields and their validation rules, quality attributes that apply, display and sort strategies, and what happens if execution fails for a systemic reason such as a network timeout. If the use case makes a durable change, say whether a failure rolls it back, completes it, or leaves it partially done._

_Data fields are specified as a table:_

| Property name | Data type | Validation rule | Security or access concerns | Glossary reference |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _[field]_ | _[type]_ | _[required, format, range]_ | _[who may see or set it]_ | _[term]_ |

**Related Use Cases.** _Other use cases this one invokes or is invoked by, by identifier and name._

**Assumptions.** _Anything assumed about this use case or how it executes._

**Open Issues.** _What you do not know yet. Mirror it into [OPEN-ISSUES.md](OPEN-ISSUES.md) so it is visible in one place._

---

## 3. Use Case List

_[Your area codes, then a table of every use case by area. Write this list first, before specifying any single use case in detail. It is the cheapest thing to review with your client, and finding out you missed a whole area costs minutes here rather than a week later.]_

| Area code | Feature area | Use cases |

**Open Issues:**

## TTS: Text-to-speech

### UC-TTS-control-playback: Control Text-to-Speech Playback

**UC ID and Name:** `UC-TTS-control-playback`: Control Text-to-Speech Playback

**Created By:** Tanner Temple

**Date Created:** November 11, 2026

**Primary Actor:** Visitor

**Secondary Actors:** The device's text-to-speech engine, or a paid speech service (`SI-device-speech`, `DE-device-tts`)

**Trigger:** While text-to-speech is reading aloud or paused on the current screen, the visitor selects Pause, Resume, Replay, Skip forward, or Skip back.

**Description:** Once Listen to content has started reading a piece of text aloud, the visitor can pause and resume it, replay it from the beginning, or skip forward or back one paragraph at a time. The controls appear on the screen that is reading, for as long as reading is active, paused, or finished on that screen. Leaving the screen still stops reading (`FR-TTS-stop-on-leave`). Starting reading, stopping it, choosing the voice language, and changing the speed belong to other use cases.

**Preconditions:**

- PRE-1. Text-to-speech, started by `UC-TTS-listen-to-content`, is reading or paused on the screen the visitor is viewing.
- PRE-2. The text being read has been split into one or more paragraphs.

**Postconditions:**

- POST-1. Reading is in the state the visitor last chose: reading from the start of the chosen paragraph, paused where it stopped, or finished.
- POST-2. Nothing is saved. The reading position is not kept after the visitor leaves the screen or the app closes.

**Main Success Scenario:**

_The visitor may use the controls in any order, any number of times. The steps below use each one once._

1. While the system is reading, the visitor selects Pause.
2. The system pauses reading where it is and shows Resume in place of Pause.
3. The visitor selects Resume.
4. The system continues reading from where it paused and shows Pause again.
5. The visitor selects Skip forward.
6. The system stops reading the current paragraph and starts reading the next paragraph from its beginning.
7. The visitor selects Skip back.
8. The system stops reading the current paragraph and starts reading the previous paragraph from its beginning.
9. The visitor selects Replay.
10. The system starts reading the whole text again from the beginning of the first paragraph.
11. The system reads to the end of the last paragraph, then shows that reading has finished, with Replay still available.
12. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**

- **5a. The visitor selects Skip forward or Skip back while reading is paused.**
    - 5a1. The system moves to the next or previous paragraph and stays paused at its beginning.
    - 5a2. Flow rejoins at step 3; Resume starts reading from that paragraph.
- **6a. The current paragraph is the last one.**
    - 6a1. The system stops reading and shows that reading has finished, as in step 11.
    - 6a2. Use case ends, or rejoins at step 9 if the visitor selects Replay.
- **8a. The current paragraph is the first one.**
    - 8a1. The system starts reading the first paragraph again from its beginning.
    - 8a2. Flow continues at step 9.
- **9a. The visitor selects Replay while reading is paused or finished.**
    - 9a1. Flow continues at step 10. Reading starts, whatever state it was in.
- **11a. Reading has finished.**
    - 11a1. The system shows only Replay. Pause, Resume, and the skip controls are not available until reading starts again.
- **\*a. The visitor leaves the screen (Home, Back, or opening another screen).**
    - \*a1. The system stops reading and removes the controls (`FR-TTS-stop-on-leave`). The reading position is not kept.
    - \*a2. Use case ends.
- **\*b. While reading, the app goes to the background or the device screen locks.**
    - \*b1. The system pauses reading where it is, as in step 2.
    - \*b2. When the visitor returns, reading is still paused with Resume shown. It never resumes by itself.
    - \*b3. Flow rejoins at step 3.
- **\*c. While reading, a phone call or another app's audio interrupts.**
    - \*c1. The system pauses reading where it is, as in step 2.
    - \*c2. When the interruption ends, reading stays paused until the visitor selects Resume.
    - \*c3. Flow rejoins at step 3.
- **\*d. While reading, the audio output is disconnected (wired headphones unplugged, or Bluetooth headphones disconnect).**
    - \*d1. The system pauses reading where it is, as in step 2, so it does not continue unexpectedly through the device's speaker.
    - \*d2. Flow rejoins at step 3.
- **\*e. The device's volume is muted or turned all the way down.**
    - \*e1. No change. The system keeps reading and does not detect or change the device volume. The visitor raises the volume with the device's own controls.
- **\*f. The speech engine fails while resuming, skipping, or replaying (an engine error, or the voice for the selected language is no longer available).**
    - \*f1. The system stops reading and shows a message in the selected language saying reading could not continue. It does not read in a different language (`SI-device-speech`).
    - \*f2. The system keeps Replay available, and the rest of the screen stays usable.
    - \*f3. If the visitor selects Replay and the engine works, flow rejoins at step 10. Otherwise use case ends.

**Priority:** High

**Frequency of Use:** Several times each time Listen to content is used, for visitors who use text-to-speech, in the gallery or remotely. With the device's built-in speech engine it adds no network load. With a paid speech service (`DE-device-tts`), each Replay or skip may be a new request to that service.

**Business Rules:** `BR-accessibility-standard`

**Associated Information:**

_Data fields (held in memory on the device for the screen that is reading; never saved):_

| Property name | Data type | Validation rule | Security or access concerns | Glossary reference |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `playbackState` | enum | Required; one of Reading, Paused, Finished. Set by `UC-TTS-listen-to-content` when reading starts, then by this use case. | Memory only | — |
| `paragraphs` | ordered list of text | Required; at least one item. Split from the text at its paragraph breaks; text with no breaks is a single paragraph (`OI-21`). | Memory only | — |
| `currentParagraph` | integer | Required; from 0 to the number of paragraphs minus 1. | Memory only | — |
| `pausedAt` | position within the current paragraph | Set at Pause; cleared by any skip or Replay. | Memory only | — |

- **Controls.** Pause and Resume share one place on screen, and only one shows at a time. Every control has a label that the device's screen reader reads (`USE-screen-reader`), is labeled in the selected language (`FR-LANG-interface-text`), and stays usable at every text size (`USE-text-scaling`). Placement is left to the design.
- **Other settings.** Changes from Voice speed and Play in selected language apply to whatever is read after a skip or Replay. This use case does not change them.
- **Resume position.** Resume continues from `pausedAt`. Whether every platform's speech engine can resume mid-paragraph is open (`OI-22`).
- **Screen reader.** The device's screen reader (VoiceOver, TalkBack) and the app's text-to-speech can both speak. What the accessibility standard requires when they overlap is open (`OI-20`).
- **Systemic failure.** This use case makes no durable change, so a failure leaves nothing to roll back (see \*f).

**Related Use Cases:**

- `UC-TTS-listen-to-content` _(not yet written)_: Starts and stops reading aloud. This use case controls reading that it started (PRE-1).
- `UC-TTS-voice-speed` _(not yet written)_: Changes the reading speed.
- `UC-TTS-play-in-selected-language` _(not yet written)_: Chooses the language of the voice.

**Assumptions:**

- There is no separate Stop control (`UC-TTS-listen-to-content`). Pause meets the requirement that the visitor can stop reading (`FR-TTS-read-description`), and leaving the screen ends reading (\*a). This use case covers Pause, Resume, Replay, and Skip.
- Skip back always goes to the start of the previous paragraph, even in the middle of the current one; it does not first restart the current paragraph.
- Skipping while paused keeps reading paused (5a).
- The IDs of use cases not yet written are coined from their names, following `UC-<AREA>-<slug>`. Their authors may choose different ones.

**Open Issues:**

- `OI-3`: Which accessibility standard applies.
- `OI-20`: Does the accessibility standard require more from these controls?
- `OI-21`: Does the text being read come with paragraph breaks?
- `OI-22`: Is resuming from the start of the paragraph acceptable where a speech engine cannot resume mid-paragraph?

## Working these with your agent

_[Delegate: drafting the main success scenario once you have the trigger and the goal; proposing extensions you have not thought of, which it is genuinely good at; turning a filled-in use case into a first set of test cases; checking that every `BR-*` you cite exists in [business-rules.md](business-rules.md).]_

_Keep human: whether this is one use case or three, what the priority is, and whether an extension the agent proposed is a real path in your client's business or a generic one it has seen elsewhere. "The system handles concurrent edits" is a real requirement for some projects and invented complexity for others, and only you have met the client._

_The verification that catches the most: read the main success scenario aloud to someone who has not read the document, and stop wherever they ask a question. Every question is a missing step or a missing extension._

_**Checklist for each use case:** Does the name start with a verb? Can the system test every precondition? Does every step alternate actor and system? Is there at least one extension per step that can fail? Does every business rule appear as an identifier only? Could a tester write test cases from this without asking you anything?_
