# Use Cases

**Project:** Monnig Meteorite Gallery Tour App
**Team:** _[Team NN]_
**Client:** _[Client name and organization]_
**Version:** 0.1

---

_**How to use this template.** Instructions appear in italic square brackets. Fill in underneath them and leave them in place until the document is stable._

_**What a use case is.** One goal a user can accomplish with your system, written as the dialogue between the actor and the system, including what happens when it goes wrong. It is the unit of work in this course: one use case becomes one issue, one branch, one pull request, and one set of tests._

_**Why the use case and not the user story.** You will meet user stories in industry, and they are a good planning tool: "As a student, I want to submit my report so that I get credit." A story is deliberately under-specified, because it is a **placeholder for a conversation** that happens later, between people. That is exactly the wrong property when the thing building your code is an agent that will implement precisely what the specification says and never ask what you meant. Use stories to plan and prioritize. Build against use cases._

_The difference that matters is the parts a story does not have: preconditions, the step-by-step flow, and above all the **extensions**, which is where the failure paths live. Most defects your team ships this semester will be in a path nobody wrote down._

## Identifiers

_Use cases are identified as `UC-<AREA>-<slug>`, where the area code groups related functionality and the slug is coined from the goal: `UC-RUB-create-rubric`, `UC-WAR-manage-activities`, `UC-STU-invite-students`._

_Pick your own area codes from your project's feature areas, three or four letters each, and list them at the top of the Use Case List. Areas correspond to the `FEAT-*` entries in your [vision and scope](vision-and-scope.md), which is where use cases come from._

_**Never renumber, rename, or repoint an identifier.** Moving a use case between areas would change its identifier, so put it in the right area the first time, and if you get it wrong, leave it. An identifier is an address, not a description._

_Within one use case, `PRE-1`, `POST-1`, and the step numbers are local and may be renumbered freely, because nothing outside the use case cites them._

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

_[One paragraph: this document specifies the goals users can accomplish with the system, in enough detail that a developer knows what to build and a tester knows what to check.]_

### 1.2 Scope

_[Which feature areas from the vision and scope are covered here. Name the `FEAT-*` entries. If a feature has no use cases yet, say so rather than leaving the reader to notice.]_

---

## 2. Use Case Template

_[The field definitions. Every use case below uses exactly these fields, in this order.]_

**UC ID and Name.** _The identifier plus a concise name stating the value this use case provides to a user. Begin with an action verb, followed by an object: "Create a rubric", not "Rubric creation" and not "Rubric management", which is a feature, not a goal._

**Created By** and **Date Created.** _Who wrote it, and when._

**Primary and Secondary Actors.** _An actor is a person or other entity outside the system that interacts with it. The primary actor initiates this use case; secondary actors participate in completing it. Actors usually correspond to the user classes you identified in the vision and scope._

**Trigger.** _The business event, system event, or user action that starts the use case. The trigger tells the system to begin testing the preconditions._

**Description.** _A brief statement of the reason for and the outcome of this use case._

**Preconditions.** _What must already be true before this use case can start. **The system must be able to test each precondition**, which is what separates a precondition from a hope. Label them `PRE-1`, `PRE-2`. Example: PRE-1. The user's identity has been authenticated._

**Postconditions.** _The state of the system at successful conclusion. Label them `POST-1`, `POST-2`. Example: POST-1. The price of the item in the database has been updated with the new value._

**Main Success Scenario.** _The actor's actions and the system's responses under normal, expected conditions, as a numbered list that alternates between the two and ends by accomplishing the goal in the name. Write "The system validates..." not "The system will validate..."; use cases are written in the present tense._

**Extensions.** _Where the real work is. Two kinds, both numbered relative to the step they branch from:_

- _**Alternative flows**, other ways the use case can still succeed. Number them `4a`, `4b` for branches from step 4, with their own sub-steps `4a1`, `4a2`. Say where the flow branches off and, if it does, where it rejoins._
- _**Exceptions**, anticipated error conditions and how the system responds. Numbered the same way._

_**A use case with no extensions is not finished.** For every step, ask: what if the input is invalid, the thing is not found, the user cancels, the user is not allowed, or the external system is down? An agent building from a flow with no failure paths will invent the error handling, and you will not find out until a demo._

**Priority.** _Relative priority of implementing this. Use the same scheme across all your use cases._

**Frequency of Use.** _Roughly how often this is performed, per an appropriate unit of time. An early indicator of load, concurrency, and transaction volume, and it is the field that tells your architecture which use cases matter._

**Business Rules.** _The `BR-*` identifiers that govern this use case. **Identifiers only, never the rule's text**, so the rule has one home in [business-rules.md](business-rules.md) and cannot go stale here._

**Associated Information.** _Everything a developer needs that is not a step: the data fields and their validation rules, quality attributes that apply, display and sort strategies, and what happens if execution fails for a systemic reason such as a network timeout. If the use case makes a durable change, say whether a failure rolls it back, completes it, or leaves it partially done._

_Data fields are specified as a table:_

| Property name | Data type | Validation rule | Security or access concerns | Glossary reference |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _[field]_ | _[type]_ | _[required, format, range]_ | _[who may see or set it]_ | _[term]_ |

**Related Use Cases.** _Other use cases this one invokes or is invoked by, by identifier and name._

**Assumptions.** _Anything assumed about this use case or how it executes._

**Open Issues.** _What you do not know yet. Mirror it into [OPEN-ISSUES.md](OPEN-ISSUES.md) so it is visible in one place._

---

## 3. Use Case List

_[Your area codes, then a table of every use case by area. Write this list first, before specifying any single use case in detail. It is the cheapest thing to review with your client, and finding out you missed a whole area costs minutes here rather than a week later.]_

| Area code | Feature area | Use cases |
|---|---|---|
| PREF | User preferences | `UC-PREF-identify-language-preference`: Identifies User Language Preference<br>`UC-PREF-customize-visual-preferences`: Customize Visual Preferences During Application Usage |

### UC-DAT-display-meteorite: Display Information Regarding a Single Meteorite

**UC ID and Name:** `UC-DAT-display-meteorite`: Display Information Regarding a Single Meteorite

**Created By:** Kendric D’Spain, Bradley Helmholz

**Date Created:** November 3, 2021

**Primary Actor:** Monnig Gallery Visitor

**Secondary Actors:** Museum Volunteers, Museum Staff

**Trigger:** The user selects a meteorite he/she wants to view in detail.

### UC-DAT-save-favorite: Save a Favorite Meteorite

**UC ID and Name:** `UC-DAT-save-favorite`: Save a Favorite Meteorite

**Created By:** Cody Pinkston

**Date Created:** November 13, 2026

**Primary Actor:** Visitor

**Secondary Actors:** None. Favorites are stored only on the visitor's device.

**Trigger:** In the meteorite view, the visitor selects the Save favorite control (`UC-DAT-view-meteorite` 5e).

**Description:** While looking at a meteorite, the visitor marks it as a favorite so they can find it again later in View favorites. The control is a toggle: it saves the meteorite if it is not a favorite and removes it if it is. Favorites are stored on the device by `monnigNumber`, with no account, and are kept across app launches. The meteorite view is the only place a favorite can be saved. Shared favorites or leaderboards need a back end and come later (minutes, 2026-11-09).

**Preconditions:**

- PRE-1. The setup survey has been completed or skipped on this device, so the app's main screens are reachable.
- PRE-2. The meteorite view is showing a meteorite's details (`UC-DAT-view-meteorite` step 4), so the Save favorite control is on screen.

**Postconditions:**

- POST-1. If the meteorite was not a favorite, its `monnigNumber` is now in the device's favorites list. If it was a favorite, its `monnigNumber` is no longer in the list.
- POST-2. The Save favorite control shows the meteorite's new state (saved or not saved).
- POST-3. The change is kept on the device across app launches until the visitor changes it again, the app is uninstalled, or a new-visitor reset is done (`FR-PREF-reset-for-new-visitor`).
- POST-4. Nothing in the catalog has changed (`FR-CONTENT-visitor-read-only`).

**Main Success Scenario:**

1. The visitor selects Save favorite in the meteorite view.
2. The system checks the device's favorites list and finds that this meteorite's `monnigNumber` is not in it.
3. The system adds the `monnigNumber` to the favorites list and saves the list on the device.
4. The system changes the control to its saved state and briefly confirms, in the selected language, that the meteorite was saved to favorites.
5. The visitor stays in the meteorite view, at the same place. Flow returns to `UC-DAT-view-meteorite` step 5.
6. Use case ends.

**Extensions:**

- **2a. The meteorite is already in the favorites list.**
    - 2a1. The system removes the `monnigNumber` from the favorites list and saves the list on the device.
    - 2a2. The system changes the control to its not-saved state and briefly confirms, in the selected language, that the meteorite was removed from favorites.
    - 2a3. Flow continues at step 5.
- **\*a. The favorites list cannot be read or saved (for example, the device storage is full).**
    - \*a1. The system shows a message, in the selected language, saying the favorite could not be saved or removed.
    - \*a2. The favorites list on the device stays as it was, and the control keeps its previous state.
    - \*a3. Flow continues at step 5.
- **\*b. The device has no network connection.**
    - \*b1. No change. Favorites are stored only on the device, so saving and removing work offline (`ROB-offline`).

**Priority:** Low. It is among the lowest-priority use cases and can be left off if time runs out (minutes, 2026-11-11).

**Frequency of Use:** Occasional. Visitors who use favorites select it a few times per visit, in the gallery or remotely (`OE-remote-use`). Every save stays on the device, so it adds no load to any server.

**Business Rules:** `BR-only-admin-can-edit-database`, `BR-accessibility-standard`

**Associated Information:**

_Data fields (stored on the device only; no account, no server):_

| Property name | Data type | Validation rule | Security or access concerns | Glossary reference |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `favorites` | list of `monnigNumber` | Starts empty. Each `monnigNumber` appears at most once. No limit on the number of favorites (author's decision, 2026-11-13). Only the `monnigNumber` is stored; anything View favorites shows about a meteorite comes from the catalog (author's decision, 2026-11-13). | Device-local. Never sent off the device (`DI-no-personal-data`). | Monnig # |

- **Persistence.** Favorites are kept across app launches. A reset of preferences (`UC-PREF-reset-preferences`) does **not** clear them. Uninstalling the app, or a new-visitor reset on a gallery-owned device (`FR-PREF-reset-for-new-visitor`, `OI-7`), does clear them (author's decision, 2026-11-13). `FR-PREF-reset-for-new-visitor` and `DI-preferences-on-device` mention only preferences, so the SRS needs to add favorites to them.
- **Accessibility.** The control shows its state without relying on color alone and has a screen-reader label in the selected language (`USE-accessibility-standard`, `USE-screen-reader`, `FR-LANG-interface-text`). Its look and placement are left to the design.

**Related Use Cases:**

- `UC-DAT-view-meteorite` _(in review)_: View a Meteorite. Holds the Save favorite control and invokes this use case at 5e.
- `UC-DAT-view-favorites` _(not yet written)_: View favorites. Lists the saved meteorites and opens each in `UC-DAT-view-meteorite`. If it lets the visitor remove a favorite, it uses the same removal as 2a.
- `UC-DAT-browse-database` _(in review)_: Browse the Meteorite Database. Its list items have no favorite control.
- `UC-PREF-reset-preferences` _(not yet written)_: Reset preferences. Does not clear favorites.

**Assumptions:**

- Favorites belong to the device, not to a person, like `VisitorPreferences` (SRS §7.1).
- One favorite per catalog record (`monnigNumber`). If the catalog holds several samples of one meteorite, each is favorited separately (`OI-4`).
- The IDs of use cases not yet written are coined from their names, following `UC-<AREA>-<slug>`. Their authors may choose different ones.

**Open Issues:**

- `OI-7`: Whether the gallery provides shared tablets, which decides whether the new-visitor reset that clears favorites is needed.
- `OI-4`: Whether the catalog distinguishes a meteorite from its samples, which decides what one favorite refers to.

## Working these with your agent

_[Delegate: drafting the main success scenario once you have the trigger and the goal; proposing extensions you have not thought of, which it is genuinely good at; turning a filled-in use case into a first set of test cases; checking that every `BR-*` you cite exists in [business-rules.md](business-rules.md).]_

_Keep human: whether this is one use case or three, what the priority is, and whether an extension the agent proposed is a real path in your client's business or a generic one it has seen elsewhere. "The system handles concurrent edits" is a real requirement for some projects and invented complexity for others, and only you have met the client._

_The verification that catches the most: read the main success scenario aloud to someone who has not read the document, and stop wherever they ask a question. Every question is a missing step or a missing extension._

_**Checklist for each use case:** Does the name start with a verb? Can the system test every precondition? Does every step alternate actor and system? Is there at least one extension per step that can fail? Does every business rule appear as an identifier only? Could a tester write test cases from this without asking you anything?_
